# Human Insurance Cost Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting human insurance costs based on various user-provided features using machine learning techniques. The project covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Data loading and exploratory analysis
- Data preprocessing (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
- Training and evaluating a machine learning model
- Predicting insurance costs based on new inputs

## Getting Started

### Running the Project in Google Colab with Google Drive
To run this notebook in Google Colab and access it from Google Drive:

1. **Upload the Notebook to Google Drive**:
   - Save the `Insurance_Cost_Prediction.ipynb` file to your Google Drive.

2. **Open the Notebook in Google Colab**:
   - Right-click the notebook file in Google Drive.
   - Select **Open with** > **Google Colab**.

3. **Mount Google Drive**:
   - At the beginning of the notebook, include the following code to mount your Google Drive:
     ```python
     from google.colab import drive
     drive.mount('/content/drive')
     ```
   - This will prompt you to authorize access to your Google Drive. Follow the instructions to grant access.

4. **Navigate to the Notebook Directory**:
   - Use the file path from your Google Drive to access any additional files required for the project:
     ```python
     %cd /content/drive/MyDrive/path-to-your-project-folder
     ```

5. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Execute the cells sequentially by clicking the **Play** button next to each one.
   - Ensure all required libraries are installed by uncommenting and running installation cells where necessary.

6. **Install Missing Libraries (if any)**:
   - If the notebook depends on external libraries not pre-installed in Colab, install them using:
     ```python
     !pip install <library-name>
     ```

## Repository Contents
- `Insurance_Cost_Prediction.ipynb`: The main notebook file.

## Output
The notebook outputs the following:
- Data visualizations and insights from exploratory data analysis
